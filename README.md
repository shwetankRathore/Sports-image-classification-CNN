# Sports-image-classification-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network was applied on 14.1K observations to classify images of twentytwo sports using ReLu and Softmax activations.

One test of this model is:

The data is collected from Kaggle. link of data: https://www.kaggle.com/rishikeshkonapure/sports-image-dataset
Here in this model we got 72.98% test accuracy and 87% train accuracy with RMSprop optimizer.
Regularisations such as dropouts and data augmentation are used to reduce overfitting.
Whole project is done using Kaggle GPU.
